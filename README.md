# City-List
Android Application that allows a user to select a destination from a list of cities

I developed this app as a prototype for a larger Train Ticket Android App, which was a group project at Mississippi College.
This app uses a local SQL database to store and track the cities available for selection.  The user can add and remove cities from the database.
When the user selects a city, the city appears on the screen.
